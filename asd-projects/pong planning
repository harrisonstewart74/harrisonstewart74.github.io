Events / Logic
What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
handleclick and handlekey events
How do those events affect the data of the program?
handlekey events affect the movement of the objects and handle click to start the game
For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
each handle key event will move an object when pressed down and then stop moving once released and the handle click will do start the game upon click of the mouse
